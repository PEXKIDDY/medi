## Connecting to GitHub

To connect this project to a GitHub repository for version control, follow these steps in your terminal from the project's root directory:

1.  **Initialize a Git Repository**: If you haven't already, initialize Git.
    ```bash
    git init -b main
    ```

2.  **Create a Repository on GitHub**: Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and create a new, empty repository. Do not initialize it with a README or any other files.

3.  **Link Your Local Project to GitHub**: Connect your local repository to the remote one on GitHub. Replace `<YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL>` with the URL provided by GitHub.
    ```bash
    git remote add origin <YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL>
    ```

4.  **Add, Commit, and Push Your Code**: Stage all your files, create an initial commit, and push your code to GitHub.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git push -u origin main
    ```
